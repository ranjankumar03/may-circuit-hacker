/**
 * Segregate 0s and 1s in an array Asked by kapil.
 * 
 * You are given an array of 0s and 1s in random order. Segregate 0s on left
 * side and 1s on right side of the array. Traverse array only once.
 * 
 * Input array = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0] Output array = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
 * 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] Method 1 (Count 0s or 1s) Thanks to Naveen for suggesting this
 * method. 1) Count the number of 0s. Let count be C. 2) Once we have count, we
 * can put C 0s at the beginning and 1s at the remaining n â€“ C positions in
 * array.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * 
 * The method 1 traverses the array two times. Method 2 does the same in a
 * single pass.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Method 2 (Use two indexes to traverse) Maintain two indexes. Initialize first
 * index left as 0 and second index right as n-1.
 * 
 * Do following while left < right a) Keep incrementing index left while there
 * are 0s at it b) Keep decrementing index right while there are 1s at it c) If
 * left < right then exchange arr[left] and arr[right]
